          <h3>Problem Solving - A Saga</h3>
          <div class="tech-body">
            <p>
              Running into problems while coding is inevitable. Learning how to deal with those problems is what can
              set
              apart a good developer and a great one. There have been several times recently I have faced challenges,
              some of which I handled well, others not so much.
            </p>
            <p>
              A recent example was when I was first trying to lay out my navigation bar for my blog. I have a bit of
              experience in HTML and CSS so I jumped right into coding my vision for a very very basic blog – the one
              you see here. Having not done any coding in several years jumping in with no plan wasn’t the best idea,
              but to hell with good ideas, I did it anyway. I quickly ran into problems. Scaling. Oh boy I remember
              struggling with this previously but my ego got the best of me and I refused to believe I didn’t know how
              to fix my navigation bar. The links were jumping around when the screen was resized, and it didn’t even
              fit the screen right in optimal conditions. I handled this issue terribly. I got frustrated and stopped
              coding for a few days because I thought coming back afresh might be all it took.
              Unfortunately sitting around doing nothing does not help improve problem solving. Having spent a few
              days
              doing nothing, I still couldn’t fix the navigation bar. I knew I was going to be able to fix the issue
              but
              not without some problem solving.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started by making a clear plan of what I wanted. I made a wire frame (sketch on paper) of the header
              and
              navigation bar and how I wanted it to look. I then finally admitted I needed some more knowledge and did
              some googling on very basic website scaling techniques. Within about 10 minutes I had discovered that
              there were some new features in HTML5 that make scaling much easier. I went back to my code and started
              using this new way of organising the content on my page. Instant results. Suddenly things were behaving
              how I wanted, and the page was starting to resemble what I envisioned initially.
              This process was not an easy one. I spent a few days frustrated and many hours mashing buttons hoping
              for
              a solution to come forward. I think the biggest take away from this is that a problem is simply a gap in
              understanding or knowledge, or a mistake you are unaware of. If you want to play golf, and you realise
              you
              haven’t got a ball, you don’t just sit down and wait for one to appear, nor do you keep searching the
              glovebox in your car that you’ve already looked through 3 times.
              Problem solving is recognising what the gap in understanding or knowledge is, and then using different
              methods to close that gap in understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another example of a conundrum I encountered recently was while coding some solutions to some javascript
              challenges. The challenges were set up as a series of tests that you must write code that passes those
              tests.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wrote what I thought was a function that would satisfy the test but unfortunately it failed. Firstly,
              the only information I had was that the test failed. I wasn’t sure why, and I wasn’t sure what my code
              was
              really doing. So, my first step was to find out what was going on, and to do this I ran the code in the
              console window, which completely ignores the test and allowed me to see what my code was doing. I was
              surprised to see that it was functioning as I expected.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, where to now? From here, I decided to look at the sample solution. The sample was different of
              course,
              and I started to have a closer look at how this solution worked. After looking carefully at my solution
              and the sample I ran them both in the console window to see if the results were different. The output
              was
              identical. From here I thought that maybe it was somehow something that the test was doing that I
              couldn’t
              see, but I don’t think this was the issue. I decided to rewrite my answer now that I had a better
              understanding of the sample solution and I came up with a version of my answer that worked. I was still
              a
              bit annoyed though as I felt like my initial answer should have worked, so in the interest of learning I
              went back and rewrote my initial answer the way I had it. It worked. I think the take away here is I
              should have been more confident in my initial solution, its more likely that I had some small syntax
              error
              that was causing the issue in the tests, which I inadvertently corrected when typing the code into
              console. The benefit of this though was it forced me to think of a new solution, and improve or
              “refactor”
              my code.
            </p>
            <h3>Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
            <h4>Do Something!</h4>
            <p>
              Now this one is pretty self explanitory. You have an issue? Start by making a start. Even if that is just
              saying to yourself "This is what
              I am trying to do, this is the problem I am having". You can't solve a problem without engaging with the
              problem. <br><br>
              This is something that I actually struggle with sometimes. I often come across a problem and lose
              motivation rapidly. I am working through
              by trying to make some of the problem solving techniques become more habitual when I am faced with issues.
            </p>
            <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
            <p>
              <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/pseudocode">The Economic Times</a> describes
              pseudocode as:
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
              "...an informal way of programming description that does not require any strict programming
              language syntax or underlying technology considerations."
            </p>
            <p>
              Put more plainly, pseudocode uses simple language to describe what you want a program do to. Pretty much
              anything can be described
              using this method. For example, lets say you want to write a function that checks a students test result,
              then lets you know if
              they have passed the test. The pseudocode might look like this:<br><br>
              If student grade is greater than 50%<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print "pass"<br>
              otherwise<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print "fail" <br><br>
              This isn't code, and it wont do anything if we leave it like that, however it gives us a really good idea
              of what we want our code
              to do. It also makes it easy to understand for people who are not familiar with the language you will end
              up writing the code in. <br>
              Pseudocode isn't something I have used a whole lot, and it will certainly take some time before I am good
              at writing good pseudocode,
              but with its advantages I am looking forward to implementing it more frequently.
            </p>
            <h4>Rubber Ducky Method</h4>
            <p>
              Ahh one of my personal favourites. One of the challenging things about.... challenges is sometimes it is
              hard to see what the issue is.
              You know its not working, you know it needs to be fixed, but what exactly is it that needs fixing?
              Sometimes it can be helpful to
              vocalise the issue, speak out loud to someone, or something (hence rubber ducky - I use a lego Llama) to
              help you articulate what it
              is you are having problems with. Spoken language uses different areas of the brain, and exercising those
              parts of your brain and attempting
              to describe the issue to a person or object can make what seems like a complicated problem much more
              simple. Often even before I have
              finished explaining what my issue is to said Llama, I know what it is I need to do to solve the problem.
            </p>
            <h4>Error Messages</h4>
            <p>
              If you make an error in your code, you should get some kind of error message displayed in the console.
              These error messages contain a lot
              of helpful information that can point you to where the issue is and how to fix it. For example, a very
              common error when learning to code
              (I do this all the time) is to forget to put an all important bracket or some other indicator that the
              browser or program running
              code relies on to function. If this happens you will likely get a syntax error. The computer knows you
              have missed something important
              and will even direct you to the line of code it thinks is the issue. Reading these error messages is an
              easy way to see if you have tried
              to ask for something that is impossible. Another example of this would be if you tried to call a function
              or variable you haven't
              decleared. In this instance you would receive a "reference error" letting you know that the thing you are referring to
              doesn't exist.<br><br>
              There are many error messages I have yet to encounter, but often googling the error will quickly let you know 
              what you have done wrong and how to fix it. I am looking forward to learning how to handle different errors using
              error messages.

          <h3>The DOM, Javascript, and HTML/CSS</h3>
          <div class="tech-body">
            <p>Alrighty folks lets do a quick simplified analogy for HTML, CSS, and Javascript
              and how they interact.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="quote">"HTML is the materials required to build a home. Css is the
              arrangement, the style, and colors. Javascript is the wiring and the plumming". <br>
              - Ben Sherwood 1856.
            </p>
            <p>We all love analogies so lets crack into another one. This time its on Control Flow and
              loops!<br>
              Control flow is essentially the order in which code is executed. Like reading english, the
              code will execute from top to bottom, left to right. There are things that can change this,
              for instance a loop. A loop is a block of code that will be repeated until a certain
              condition
              is met. I know, I know, I promised a wonderful analogy and here it is: <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>Control flow is like following a recipe for chocolate brownies.
              You do each step as it comes. When it comes to cooking, you may need to take
              the brownie out and stick a skewer in the center to check its cooked. If the
              skewer comes out with mix stuck to it, you'll need to put it back in the oven
              for a few minutes longer and check again until the brownie is cooked. This step
              of checking if the brownie is cooked is the loop, and it alters the control flow
              because it keeps going back to the step of putting the brownie in the oven until its
              cooked and the statement "isCooked == true".
            </p>
            <h4>THE IMPENDING DOM</h4>
            <p>Wikipedia describes the DOM as:<br></p>
            <p class="quote">.. a cross-platform and language-independent
              application programming interface that treats an HTML, XHTML, or XML document as a tree
              structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document.</p>
            <p>Essentially the DOM is a way of oragnising a document into a tree structure with each element
              a node on the tree. This allows each node to be accessed independently by javascript
              functions.
            </p>
            <p>To access the DOM, we can use the console in developer tools on a web browser, but the
              standard
              way
              is to have javascript files linked to the HTML. The code below changes the background color
              by
              accessing the DOM:<br>
              document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'fuchsia'; </p>
            <h4> Accessing data from objects and arrays</h4>
            <p>Firstly, what is a javascript array?<br>
              an array can hold many values under a single name. These values can be accessed
              by referring to an index number.
              Consider the array:<br><br> var cars = ["Subaru", "Honda", "Toyota"]<br><br>
              cars is a variable that points to an array of strings. Each value in the array has an index,
              starting at 0. These values can be accessed as follows: <br><br>
              cars[0] will return "Subaru" cars[1] will return "Honda" and so on.<br><br>
              Pretty much everything in javascript is an object. A good way to thinka= about a javascript
              object
              is that it is a collection of named values. Have a look below at the object example:<br><br>
              var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};<br><br>
              the variable "person" points to an object that has a collection of different named values.
              These names are referred to as the object properties, and information after the colon is
              simply the value.<br><br>
              There are two ways to access the property values. Dot notation and bracket notation.
              <br><br>
              person.firstName would give the value for the property firstName. person["firstName"] will
              do
              the same.
            </p>
            <h4>Functions and why they are useful</h4>
            <p>One way to think of a javascript program is as a collection of subprograms called functions.
              Functions perform a specific task and are only executed when they are called. Fuctions can
              take values as arguments which can be used within the functon. The reason functions are
              useful
              is it allows for certain code to be ignored until called by the script. This code can be
              reused
              with new arguments passed any number of times.
            </p>

          <h3>A guide to Margins, Borders, and Padding</h3>
          <div class="tech-body">
            <img src="../images/marginlesson.gif">
            <p>To understand Margins, borders, and padding, first we must understand how html
              elements are viewed by the browser. Pretty much every html element has an invisible
              box around the content. Circular Image? It will have a square box with the circles
              diameter as the width and height.<br><br></p>
          </div>
          <h4>Padding</h4>
          <div class="tech-body">
            <p>Now, With the above in mind lets take a look at padding. Padding is the space between
              the content of the element, and the invisible box around the content.
            </p>
            <p>
              To set padding in CSS it is very simple. Select the element you want to change
              using css, and add a padding attribute like this:<br><br> p{<br>padding-top:
              5px;<br>}<br><br>
              This will
              add
              a
              5px space between the content and the invisible box the content sits in. We can add more
              padding by using other variations of the attribute, like padding-right or padding-bottom,
              but there is an easier way!<br> Enter, padding. You can use just "padding" to choose all 4
              sides
              at the same time like this:<br> p{<br>padding:5px 10px 5px 10px;<br>}.<br> This adds 5px
              padding
              around the content
              on all sides.<br> If you are using equal padding for each side, you can just use:<br> p{<br>
              padding: 5px;<br>}<br>
              This will automatically apply the 5px to each side. In terms of knowing which number will
              impact
              which side of padding, its simple: Think clockwise starting at 12. Top, right, bottom,
              left.<br>
              So, in our first example the top and bottom padding is 5px and the left and right padding is
              10px.<br>
              Looks like you are pros... lets now define that invisible box... Onwards to borders!
              <br>
            </p>
            <h4>Borders</h4>
            <p>Adding a border does just that. It adds a border to one or more sides of our
              "invisible" box. I often like to put a border around an element even if i don't
              plan on leaving it there when I am working out how I want to position the item,
              as it makes it easier to align elements.<br>
              Borders have many different combinations of attriubtes, I will show you the basic
              premise for creating a border, and you can see more <a
                href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp">advanced options at w3school.</a>
              <br><br>
              p{border: solid black 1px}<br><br>
              This is a very simple border. It is a solid line, the color is black and it is 1px wide.
              There are many styles of border like dotted, dashed, double, and more. The color attribute
              will
              take
              either a standard color, or a hexidecimal code, like #92B359 - the green color used on this
              post
              border.<br>
              The above style is actually condensing several different css commands:<br><br>
              p{<br>
              border-style: solid;<br>
              border-color: black;<br>
              border-width: 1px;<br>
              }<br><br>
              Just like padding we can apply different styles to different sides of our element:<br><br>
              border-width: 1px 5px 1px 5px;<br><br>
              This would give you a top and bottom border 1px wide, and left and right a width of 5px.
              The same thing can be done for color and style:<br><br>
              border-color: red black pink green;<br><br>
              border-style: dotted dashed solid double;<br><br>
              Crazy colors. Crazy styles.

            <H4>Margins</H4>
            <p>Hey look! We are onto margins already and its only 3am!<br>
              Margins work a lot like padding, except instead of increasing space between content and our
              invisible box (or visible if you have a border!) it increases space between the whole
              element
              and
              other elements around it.<br>
              Lets look at the css for this: <br><br>
              p{<br>
              margin: 5px;<br>
              }<br>
              p{<br>
              margin 5px 2px 5px 2px;<br>
              }<br>
              p{<br>
              margin-top:5px;<br>
              margin-right: 2px;<br>
              margin-bottom: 5px;<br>
              margin-left: 2px;<br>
              }<br>
              You can see its almost identical to the padding! The first example sets a 5px width
              for each side. - The second example sets each margin width following our clock
              top, right, bottom, left. The fourth and final example individually sets each margin.
              <br><br>
              So thats all there is to it! Borders, Padding, and Margins are essential for ensuring your
              website looks good and is layed out how you want. Play around, see what works, see what
              doesn't,
              and most importantly of all, have fun!
