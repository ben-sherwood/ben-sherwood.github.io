                    <div class="tech-body">
                        <p>Alrighty folks lets do a quick simplified analogy for HTML, CSS, and Javascript
                            and how they interact.<br><br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="quote">"HTML is the materials required to build a home. Css is the
                            arrangement, the style, and colors. Javascript is the wiring and the plumming". <br>
                            - Ben Sherwood 1856.
                        </p>
                        <p>We all love analogies so lets crack into another one. This time its on Control Flow and
                            loops!<br>
                            Control flow is essentially the order in which code is executed. Like reading english, the
                            code will execute from top to bottom, left to right. There are things that can change this,
                            for instance a loop. A loop is a block of code that will be repeated until a certain
                            condition
                            is met. I know, I know, I promised a wonderful analogy and here it is: <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <p>Control flow is like following a recipe for chocolate brownies.
                            You do each step as it comes. When it comes to cooking, you may need to take
                            the brownie out and stick a skewer in the center to check its cooked. If the
                            skewer comes out with mix stuck to it, you'll need to put it back in the oven
                            for a few minutes longer and check again until the brownie is cooked. This step
                            of checking if the brownie is cooked is the loop, and it alters the control flow
                            because it keeps going back to the step of putting the brownie in the oven until its
                            cooked and the statement "isCooked == true".
                        </p>
                        <h4>THE IMPENDING DOM</h4>
                        <p>Wikipedia describes the DOM as:<br></p>
                        <p class="quote">.. a cross-platform and language-independent
                            application programming interface that treats an HTML, XHTML, or XML document as a tree
                            structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document.</p>
                        <p>Essentially the DOM is a way of oragnising a document into a tree structure with each element
                            a node on the tree. This allows each node to be accessed independently by javascript
                            functions.
                        </p>
                        <p>To access the DOM, we can use the console in developer tools on a web browser, but the
                            standard
                            way
                            is to have javascript files linked to the HTML. The code below changes the background color
                            by
                            accessing the DOM:<br>
                            document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'fuchsia'; </p>
                        <h4> Accessing data from objects and arrays</h4>
                        <p>Firstly, what is a javascript array?<br>
                            an array can hold many values under a single name. These values can be accessed
                            by referring to an index number.
                            Consider the array:<br><br> var cars = ["Subaru", "Honda", "Toyota"]<br><br>
                            cars is a variable that points to an array of strings. Each value in the array has an index,
                            starting at 0. These values can be accessed as follows: <br><br>
                            cars[0] will return "Subaru" cars[1] will return "Honda" and so on.<br><br>
                            Pretty much everything in javascript is an object. A good way to thinka= about a javascript
                            object
                            is that it is a collection of named values. Have a look below at the object example:<br><br>
                            var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};<br><br>
                            the variable "person" points to an object that has a collection of different named values.
                            These names are referred to as the object properties, and information after the colon is
                            simply the value.<br><br>
                            There are two ways to access the property values. Dot notation and bracket notation.
                            <br><br>
                            person.firstName would give the value for the property firstName. person["firstName"] will
                            do
                            the same.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Functions and why they are useful</h4>
                        <p>One way to think of a javascript program is as a collection of subprograms called functions.
                            Functions perform a specific task and are only executed when they are called. Fuctions can
                            take values as arguments which can be used within the functon. The reason functions are
                            useful
                            is it allows for certain code to be ignored until called by the script. This code can be
                            reused
                            with new arguments passed any number of times.

                    <h3>A guide to Margins, Borders, and Padding</h3>
                    <div class="tech-body">
                        <img src="../images/marginlesson.gif">
                        <p>To understand Margins, borders, and padding, first we must understand how html
                            elements are viewed by the browser. Pretty much every html element has an invisible
                            box around the content. Circular Image? It will have a square box with the circles
                            diameter as the width and height.<br><br></p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>Padding</h4>
                    <div class="tech-body">
                        <p>Now, With the above in mind lets take a look at padding. Padding is the space between
                            the content of the element, and the invisible box around the content.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To set padding in CSS it is very simple. Select the element you want to change
                            using css, and add a padding attribute like this:<br><br> p{<br>padding-top:
                            5px;<br>}<br><br>
                            This will
                            add
                            a
                            5px space between the content and the invisible box the content sits in. We can add more
                            padding by using other variations of the attribute, like padding-right or padding-bottom,
                            but there is an easier way!<br> Enter, padding. You can use just "padding" to choose all 4
                            sides
                            at the same time like this:<br> p{<br>padding:5px 10px 5px 10px;<br>}.<br> This adds 5px
                            padding
                            around the content
                            on all sides.<br> If you are using equal padding for each side, you can just use:<br> p{<br>
                            padding: 5px;<br>}<br>
                            This will automatically apply the 5px to each side. In terms of knowing which number will
                            impact
                            which side of padding, its simple: Think clockwise starting at 12. Top, right, bottom,
                            left.<br>
                            So, in our first example the top and bottom padding is 5px and the left and right padding is
                            10px.<br>
                            Looks like you are pros... lets now define that invisible box... Onwards to borders!
                            <br>
                        </p>
                        <h4>Borders</h4>
                        <p>Adding a border does just that. It adds a border to one or more sides of our
                            "invisible" box. I often like to put a border around an element even if i don't
                            plan on leaving it there when I am working out how I want to position the item,
                            as it makes it easier to align elements.<br>
                            Borders have many different combinations of attriubtes, I will show you the basic
                            premise for creating a border, and you can see more <a
                                href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp">advanced options at w3school.</a>
                            <br><br>
                            p{border: solid black 1px}<br><br>
                            This is a very simple border. It is a solid line, the color is black and it is 1px wide.
                            There are many styles of border like dotted, dashed, double, and more. The color attribute
                            will
                            take
                            either a standard color, or a hexidecimal code, like #92B359 - the green color used on this
                            post
                            border.<br>
                            The above style is actually condensing several different css commands:<br><br>
                            p{<br>
                            border-style: solid;<br>
                            border-color: black;<br>
                            border-width: 1px;<br>
                            }<br><br>
                            Just like padding we can apply different styles to different sides of our element:<br><br>
                            border-width: 1px 5px 1px 5px;<br><br>
                            This would give you a top and bottom border 1px wide, and left and right a width of 5px.
                            The same thing can be done for color and style:<br><br>
                            border-color: red black pink green;<br><br>
                            border-style: dotted dashed solid double;<br><br>
                            Crazy colors. Crazy styles.
                        </p>
                        <H4>Margins</H4>
                        <p>Hey look! We are onto margins already and its only 3am!<br>
                            Margins work a lot like padding, except instead of increasing space between content and our
                            invisible box (or visible if you have a border!) it increases space between the whole
                            element
                            and
                            other elements around it.<br>
                            Lets look at the css for this: <br><br>
                            p{<br>
                            margin: 5px;<br>
                            }<br>
                            p{<br>
                            margin 5px 2px 5px 2px;<br>
                            }<br>
                            p{<br>
                            margin-top:5px;<br>
                            margin-right: 2px;<br>
                            margin-bottom: 5px;<br>
                            margin-left: 2px;<br>
                            }<br>
                            You can see its almost identical to the padding! The first example sets a 5px width
                            for each side. - The second example sets each margin width following our clock
                            top, right, bottom, left. The fourth and final example individually sets each margin.
                            <br><br>
                            So thats all there is to it! Borders, Padding, and Margins are essential for ensuring your
                            website looks good and is layed out how you want. Play around, see what works, see what
                            doesn't,
                            and most importantly of all, have fun!
