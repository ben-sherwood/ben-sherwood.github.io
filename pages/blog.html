                <h3>Learning Plan</h3>
                <h4>My Strengths:</h4>
                <p>
                    Communication is something I would say I do very well. I have grown up in a very open and honest
                    family which has helped me be forthcoming with my problems. In the last 4 years I have been
                    medicated for MDD (Massive Depressive Disorder) and this has further helped my communication
                    skills. I am willing to ask for help when needed and admit when I am struggling. Working for
                    many years in hospitality has helped my communication by giving me experience working with
                    complete strangers and colleagues alike – very different to family and friends and has
                    encouraged my communication style to become adaptable.<br><br>

                    Honesty is another trait that I think is vital to good communication as communication isn’t possible
                    if you are not completely open with your peers. I do my best to present all information to help make
                    calculated decisions with others.<br><br>

                    Perfectionism could be both negative and positive, and I will come to the downsides in my
                    weaknesses. I try hard to do everything at 100%. I put a lot of pressure on myself to produce the
                    best results I can.
                </p>
                <h4>Weaknesses:</h4>
                <p>Oh boy there are many. Like I said above, far easier to criticise oneself than complement.
                    <br><br>
                    I am a very emotional person. I often let my emotions rule my decision making rather than having a
                    balance of emotion and rationality guide me. I call this balance of rationality and emotions wise
                    mind, and I try and balance myself when I am stressed and tired to prevent myself being overwhelmed
                    by emotions which can be debilitating. <br><br>

                    Back to perfectionism. I often find that if I can’t do something exactly the way I want, I give up.
                    I’d rather not do it than be disappointed with my result, and this has been a major player in the
                    way I have lived my life. I am slowly getting better at dealing with this and hope it won’t be too
                    much of a problem when it comes to this course.<br><br>

                    I also often withdraw into myself when things get tough. This is something I have been better at
                    recently, and rather than withdrawing I will communicate with people about why I feel like running
                    away from what ever problem I have. Looking for support when I feel like this is essential to my
                    sticking power.
                </p>
                <h4>How I will manage myself:</h4>
                <p>
                    With my main strengths and weaknesses outlined, lets have a look at how I can manage my time and
                    energy while completing this course.<br><br>

                    Firstly, while my communication is a strength, I often don’t really communicate with myself, and
                    this often leads to a snowball effect where I then get frustrated and withdraw into myself.
                    Something I have discovered even just since starting foundations is being organized cures this. When
                    I say communicating with myself, I mean outlining and vocalising what it is I want, and how I want
                    to achieve this. I started using sticky notes on windows to do this, by outlining weekly and daily
                    things I want to achieve. I split larger tasks into smaller ones so I can continually feel a sense
                    of accomplishment as I work. I think this has been incredibly helpful and I have since upgraded from
                    sticky notes to an app called <a href="https://todoist.com/?lang=en">todoist</a>.<br><br> This app allows me
                    to have multiple projects each with
                    multiple tasks. I can set dates and times for each and drag and drop between different projects and
                    deadlines. This makes managing my workload simple and also gives me the satisfaction of marking
                    things as complete. If I need to do something for someone, or get help from someone, I add these in
                    as tasks. This again makes it easy for me to remain true to my commitments and keep up those
                    channels of communication.<br><br>

                    Seeking help isn’t something I should be afraid of, we learn by failing and reflecting, and often
                    part of that reflection comes in the form of advice from others. My plan for seeking help is
                    this:<br><br>

                    Encounter problem – I look at the problem, try and break it down, and give myself a time limit to
                    solve the problem on my own. If I still am struggling with a problem, I will seek help from my peers
                    on slack. While waiting for a response I will keep on troubleshooting. Hopefully by this stage I
                    will have solved the issue on my own, if not the advice from others should be another tool to solve
                    the issue. If all else fails after these steps my final place to turn is my facilitators. This is a
                    last resort as I feel the best way to learn is to teach yourself, and asking others and helping
                    others is also a great way to help yourself, and them learn. I’m assuming my facilitators are gods,
                    their time is better spent changing the world, not fixing my nav bar issues.<br><br>

                    What I do want to see from my gods is support. Encouragement, communication, advice and respect.

                <h3>Values and Strenghts</h3>
                <h4>My Values:</h4>
                <p>So interestingly I have done a lot of work around beliefs and values as I was doing a type of
                    therapy called CBT. CBT is very value and goals focused. As part of this therapy I chose 6
                    values I feel are important to me. I got to 6 after going through a list of around 50. It
                    was quite a challenge to do this!</p>

                <a name="Self-Knowledge"></a>
                <h4>Self-Knowledge</h4>
                <p>Self-knowledge is very important to me. I was diagnosed with MDD (massive depressive disorder)
                    and the only way to have any chance of recovering is to have a strong sense of self and to
                    understand how I respond to the world around me. The more I learn about myself, the better I
                    can deal with any difficulty that arises.</p>
                <a name="Contribution"></a>
                <h4>Contribution</h4>
                <p>Contribution is something I really hold as a core value. We can only progress as a community/
                    society/species if we make lasting and meaningful contributions to those communities. I want
                    my legacy to be something lasting I have done for my community. At the moment I am passionate
                    about making change in mental health awareness, I am just yet to decide how to do this.</p>
                <a name="Growth"></a>
                <h4>Growth</h4>
                <p>Growth is similar to self knowledge. Growth is a biproduct of self knowledge as the more we
                    understand about ourselves, the more we grow as a person. Growth to me also means improving my
                    understandings of the world, my skills as an individual and my connection with my surroundings.</p>
                <a name="Generosity"></a>
                <h4>Generosity</h4>
                <p>Generosity is exactly as it sounds. being generous with my time and my wealth. Offer it when and
                    where I can.</p>
                <a name="Humilty"></a>
                <h4>Humilty</h4>
                <p>Humilty is to conduct myself without ego, never assume anything about anyone, let my actions
                    reflect who I am. Be humble in my failures and in my successes.</p>
                <a name="Family"></a>
                <h4>Family</h4>
                <p>Family is the cornerstone of my life. I stand upon the shoulders of my family, they are my
                    giants. I want to continue this value, and help build on this value to ensure those new members
                    can experience the love, kindness, and safety that my family has given me.</p>

                <h4>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the
                    values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
                </h4>
                <p>I recently was walking home from the supermarket in Newtown. I witnessed two girls begin to fight.
                    They were very aggressive towards each other, punching, kicking and hair-pulling. Many people were
                    standing around some were avoiding the situation by crossing the street. <br><br>
                    I made a decision to stop the fight by putting myself between them, and quickly someone else came to
                    help pull them apart. While I didn't have a huge amount of time to think about why I was doing what
                    I was doing, I feel that I acted with humility - I didn't judge or assume, I just knew that if I was
                    in that position, I would want someone to help deescalate the situation. It was also a situation
                    that allowed me to grow as a person. I am not a confident person, nor am I physcially imposing but I
                    stood up for what I believe in and decided to stop two young people making a terrible mistake. I
                    made sure both girls were alright, so I guess you could say I was also generous? It wasn't a nice
                    situation but I hate the idea of people standing around filming or laughing. Thats not the person I
                    am.</p>
                <h4>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h4>
                <p>It's hard to say what my culture really is. I come from a family who encourage and respect openness,
                    honesty, love, and diveristy. We thrive on our differences and celebrate thinking for ourselves and
                    doing what we believe is right within our societies. I am lucky to be able to speak freely with my
                    sisters and parents. This has given me an appreciation for listening to others and being open to
                    changes. I value family so highly as I am lucky to be from an incredibly caring network of family
                    members. They encourage growth, and we always push eachother to discover new things about the world,
                    our communities, and ourselves. This openness and caring environment breeds humility and I am so
                    greatful for that.</p>
                <h4>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h4>
                <p>Some of my strenghts are also weaknesses. For one, I am a perfectionist. I strive to be the best I
                    can be when it comes to submitting work. Sometimes this prevents me from actually even starting as I
                    am also so afraid of failure, or not being satisfied with the work I have done --- I think my brain
                    also sees this as a failure. A big strenght of mine is being able to listen and understand people. I
                    pride myself on my ability to interact with others and feel this will be a real asset when it comes
                    to finding work, but also in learning as I can understand others well, which will help in learning
                    from others as well as helping others when they may need it.</p>
                <h4>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might
                    intersect with learning obstacles.</h4>
                <p>I think my social skills will be vital on this learning journey as like I said above it means I am
                    able to listen and understand other peoples ideas and perspectives, even if they are different to my
                    own. When it comes to learning, experiencing problems from multiple angles can be incredibly
                    benefical as sometimes the best solution is one you wouldn't normally think of. Being surrounded by
                    other people and being able to interact, listen, and understand is vital (in my opinion) to
                    learning. As far as obstacles go, being able to listen and communicate effecitvely can make mole
                    hills of mountains. It can turn a very complex and daunting challenge into something fun and
                    exciting, as you get to experience the issue from multiple different angles.</p>
                <h4>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but
                    there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they
                    were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h4>
                <p>This might be a stretch, but its a recent example and one which I think outlines qualitites in
                    myself, and the other person involved. I was on the Spirit of New Zealand for a week with a group of
                    26 other people all aged between 18 and 65(ish). The Spirit is a tall mast ship that has no powered
                    form of winches to haul the sails up. Many aspects of the boat are very physical and require the
                    team to be cohesive. There was a situation where I was up one of the masts with a young girl, we
                    were preparing the sails to be hauled after riasing the anchor. Part of this process requires you to
                    walk out along the yard (the wooden beams that run horizontal to the mast) and push a sheet off the
                    yard. While out on the yards you are anywhere from 15m to 30m high, rolling from side to side while
                    having to work with your hands. Its challenging. I loved being up in the rigging - its exciting,
                    physically challenging, and offers a breath-taking view of the sea and landscape around you.
                    Karleigha, the girl who was helping me did not share my enthusiasm for being up there, but wanted to
                    experience life on the ship fully. She was out on the yard with me next to her, and was trying to
                    push the sheet off the yard. She was having difficulty and wasn't enjoying being up that high. She
                    asked if we could swap, however once out on the yard you cannot move past another person. I offered
                    her encouragement and support and gave her some tips that I had found helpful while doing the same
                    process on the upper square sails. Being positive and encouraging in the face of this challenge I
                    think was essential to us managing to finish the work on the sails. Karleigha got the chance to
                    prove to herself that she could do it, and I think me helping not only gave her confidence but also
                    gave myself confidence too. I had struggled and also found it challenging, so being able to relate
                    while also offering things I had found helpful was a great way of removing the tensions we both had,
                    and being positive and friendly also encouraged her to do the work - A fantastic experience in
                    learning and challenge for us both. In the future I think I would use the same positivity and energy
                    that I used in that situation, however many of the challenges I will be facing I wont have
                    experienced before, so learning how to keep this positive energy while not knowing the solution will
                    be vital. Its easy to lose hope when you dont know how to solve a problem. I think I like this
                    "positive/encouraging" approach is good because it encourages people to find solutions themselves,
                    which is immensly rewarding. Karleigha was beaming after her achievement, and rightfully so. She did
                    something she didn't think possible of herself, and I can't wait to have many of those moments in my
                    learning journey with Dev Academy</p>
                <h4>Post I shared to Slack</h4>
                <p>Howdy friends - Time to share a bit about myself for sprint 1! My name is Ben Sherwood, and I am
                    based in Wellington. I grew up in Nelson, and spent some time studying down in Dunedin. I've just
                    been doing some stuff around values and identity and wanted to share some things I have been
                    thinking about.
                    I have done quite a bit of CBT - Cultural behavioral Therapy, and this kind of therapy is focused on
                    values and goal setting so I have quite a good idea about what my core values are. I am quite a self
                    critical person, and what I found immensely valuable was hearing how my friends and whanau see me,
                    and what they think my core values are. I think this is good at letting us now how we act, and what
                    our actions say about our values. Some of the values I would say are important to me didn't come up
                    at all when my friends and family talked to me about it, some did, and there were some new ones too.
                    This highlights that perhaps there are some values that I need to focus on and make sure I am living
                    to those values. Anyway sorry to ramble on about values!
                    One last thing .... Why am I doing Dev Academy? Easy. I'm doing it because I enjoy development, I
                    like the creative yet technical challenges Web Development brings, and also I have some personal
                    projects that would benefit greatly from having experience in development!
                    Thanks a lot for tolerating this long post!</p>

                <h3>A guide to Margins, Borders, and Padding</h3>
                <div class="tech-body">
                    <img src="../images/marginlesson.gif">
                    <p>To understand Margins, borders, and padding, first we must understand how html
                        elements are viewed by the browser. Pretty much every html element has an invisible
                        box around the content. Circular Image? It will have a square box with the circles
                        diameter as the width and height.<br><br></p>
                </div>
                <h4>Padding</h4>
                <div class="tech-body">
                    <p>Now, With the above in mind lets take a look at padding. Padding is the space between
                        the content of the element, and the invisible box around the content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To set padding in CSS it is very simple. Select the element you want to change
                        using css, and add a padding attribute like this:<br><br> p{<br>padding-top: 5px;<br>}<br><br>
                        This will
                        add
                        a
                        5px space between the content and the invisible box the content sits in. We can add more
                        padding by using other variations of the attribute, like padding-right or padding-bottom,
                        but there is an easier way!<br> Enter, padding. You can use just "padding" to choose all 4 sides
                        at the same time like this:<br> p{<br>padding:5px 10px 5px 10px;<br>}.<br> This adds 5px padding
                        around the content
                        on all sides.<br> If you are using equal padding for each side, you can just use:<br> p{<br>
                        padding: 5px;<br>}<br>
                        This will automatically apply the 5px to each side. In terms of knowing which number will impact
                        which side of padding, its simple: Think clockwise starting at 12. Top, right, bottom, left.<br>
                        So, in our first example the top and bottom padding is 5px and the left and right padding is
                        10px.<br>
                        Looks like you are pros... lets now define that invisible box... Onwards to borders!
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Borders</h4>
                    <p>Adding a border does just that. It adds a border to one or more sides of our
                        "invisible" box. I often like to put a border around an element even if i don't
                        plan on leaving it there when I am working out how I want to position the item,
                        as it makes it easier to align elements.<br>
                        Borders have many different combinations of attriubtes, I will show you the basic
                        premise for creating a border, and you can see more <a
                            href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp">advanced options at w3school.</a>
                        <br><br>
                        p{border: solid black 1px}<br><br>
                        This is a very simple border. It is a solid line, the color is black and it is 1px wide.
                        There are many styles of border like dotted, dashed, double, and more. The color attribute will
                        take
                        either a standard color, or a hexidecimal code, like #92B359 - the green color used on this post
                        border.<br>
                        The above style is actually condensing several different css commands:<br><br>
                        p{<br>
                        border-style: solid;<br>
                        border-color: black;<br>
                        border-width: 1px;<br>
                        }<br><br>
                        Just like padding we can apply different styles to different sides of our element:<br><br>
                        border-width: 1px 5px 1px 5px;<br><br>
                        This would give you a top and bottom border 1px wide, and left and right a width of 5px.
                        The same thing can be done for color and style:<br><br>
                        border-color: red black pink green;<br><br>
                        border-style: dotted dashed solid double;<br><br>
                        Crazy colors. Crazy styles.
                    </p>
                    <H4>Margins</H4>
                    <p>Hey look! We are onto margins already and its only 3am!<br>
                        Margins work a lot like padding, except instead of increasing space between content and our
                        invisible box (or visible if you have a border!) it increases space between the whole element
                        and
                        other elements around it.<br>
                        Lets look at the css for this: <br><br>
                        p{<br>
                        margin: 5px;<br>
                        }<br>
                        p{<br>
                        margin 5px 2px 5px 2px;<br>
                        }<br>
                        p{<br>
                        margin-top:5px;<br>
                        margin-right: 2px;<br>
                        margin-bottom: 5px;<br>
                        margin-left: 2px;<br>
                        }<br>
                        You can see its almost identical to the padding! The first example sets a 5px width
                        for each side. - The second example sets each margin width following our clock
                        top, right, bottom, left. The fourth and final example individually sets each margin.
                        <br><br>
                        So thats all there is to it! Borders, Padding, and Margins are essential for ensuring your
                        website looks good and is layed out how you want. Play around, see what works, see what doesn't,
                        and most importantly of all, have fun!

            <h3 class="blog-heading">What is Github?</h3>
            <p class="date">07/03/2019</p>
            <p class="blog-body">Github is a service that hosts code and git files. The service allows multiple people
                to
                work on the same git repositiories.
                It helps make bugfixing easier, while also preventing errors.
                A very poor analogy of git and github would be like several people working on a painting seperately. The
                paint their bit on plastic
                sheets and lay those changes ontop of each other before making the changes on the canvas final. If
                something
                is not right, they
                can fix it....terrible analogy :/
                I think I would still know the difference in a week as its something I have done a bit before, but I am
                looking forward to using them both more
                as it will be a great chance to learn more and get familiar with them both.
                Yes, I managed to stick to timebox guides as I have done a bit of this before. I did some further
                reading
                and feel ready for coming challenges.</p>

            <h3 class="blog-heading">What is Github Workflow?</h3>
            <p class="date">08/03/2019</p>
            <p class="blog-body">A Workflow is a recommendation for how to use git efficiently and effectively. A
                workflow in git is an agreed upon method of submitting commits and tracking changes between
                one or more developers. A workflow should be able to easily track changes, as well as easily undo
                mistakes and errors. The workflow should not be an added burden.</p>
            <h3>What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?</h3>
            <p class="blog-body">I was actually really happy with my learning during this block of work. While I was
                being asked questions on Log information, I was thinking "Man there must be an easier way
                to search for information on commits in the logs other than scrolling through every commit, so I did
                some further reading at that time and learned about git log --oneline
                as well as things like git log grep="" to find certain strings in the commit message. These proved very
                helpful and sped up my learning.
                Sure enough, these methods of refining git log information came up further on in the 4 lessons, but I am
                really happy that I was motivated and curious to find better methods
                of refining the log information. If I apply this same curiosity as the course progresses I am confident
                I will maximize my learning.</p>
            <h3>Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?</h3>
            <p class="blog-body">Yes! I wouldn't do it at 1am in the morning! I was so keen to get started on the course
                I did some of it quite late at night. I think this is not ideal as I found it harder
                to remember some of the information in the morning. Doing study while energized and refreshed seems to
                be far more effective than while tired and sleepy! When the course
                officially starts on the 11/03/2019 I will make sure I stick to my allocated study time 9am - 5pm to
                ensure I am not only getting in plenty of coding, but coding during the
                day where my brain is most active! I will also endevour to make good use of my reset time to ensure I am
                ready to go the next day. I also have done previous reflection using
                powershell Set-Content as practice, but I wasn't sure how to add more content... Since writing this I
                now see you can use the Add-Content cmdlet to append more to the file!</p>
            <h3>How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?</h3>
            <p class="blog-body">Imagine you are in a supermarket, thinking of a recipe to cook that night. You wander
                around deciding what ingredients you need, adding them to your basket. Your basket is the
                "stage". The stage is a place where you are telling the supermarket "these are the things I want you to
                focus on, these are going to be the things I want to take out of the
                store, ready for my guests to enjoy". When you "commit" You are going to the checkout and saying "I want
                these items in my basket (stage) to be accessable to my guests"</p>
            <h3 class="blog-heading">What are some examples of when you would fork?</h3>
            <p class="blog-body">Forking a repo is to take a copy of an exisiting repo. It allows you to play around and
                experiment with changes and features without affecting the origional Repo. A few examples of when you
                might fork a repo:
                Suggesting changes to someone elses project
                Using someone elses project as a starting point for your own project
                It can be also used when working on an open source project. It allows each developer to commit changes
                to their own forked repo without writing changes to the main repo. This allows the admin or owner of the
                repo to select what commits are submitted to the main repo while maintaing security</p>

            <h3 class="blog-heading">Write your own step-by-step fork and clone instructions. Describe what you did.
            </h3>
            <p class="blog-body">Step 1 Create the Fork:<br>
                Navigate to the github repo that you want to fork. In the top right on the page is the "fork" button.
                Click this. Github will ask you where you would like this new Repo to be located. Just select your
                username - do not nest this in another repo.<br>
                Step 2 Clone this repo:<br>
                Navigate to this newly forked repo on github and click the green button to the right of the screen
                labeled "clone or download". Copy the repo URL and open gitbash. use cd commands to navigate to the
                directory you want this cloned repo to be located. Clone the git by using the command *git clone*
                (the-link-you-just-copied)

                Congratulations! You now have forked a repo, and cloned it so you have a local copy. You can now
                add, commit and branch just like normal.</p>

            <h3 class="blog-heading">Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?</h3>
            <p class="blog-body">I didn't find this challenge to difficult, as many of the skills applied were learned
                in previous primers and research I have done myself. I did forget that if you have created a new branch
                locally, you cant just git push as there is no upstream branch. to do this you must use: git push
                --set-upstream origin (the-name-of-the-branch)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-post">
            <h3 class="blog-heading">What is the difference between cloning from a forked or non-forked repo.</h3>
            <p class="date">11/03/2019</p>
            <p class="blog-body">When you fork a repo you are creating a copy of that repo registered under your own
                github account. When you clone from a forked repo, all changes made will only effect your copy of the
                repo. The origional repo and the forked repo still are both tracked, but you cant make specific changes
                to the origional repo. When you clone a non forked repo you can make permanent changes to that repo. A
                forked repo is handy if you dont want to worry about read write permissions as anyone who forks the repo
                can only make changes to their forked copy.</p>
            <h3 class="blog-heading">Can you think of an analogy to describe forking?</h3>
            <p class="blog-body">Think about a google doc file is storing an essay if you make that file public or share
                with certain people, they can access that file and make changes in a colabritive way. The main file is
                being changed. Forking is like the origional owner copying "essay.txt" to create "essay2.txt" each
                person has acess to their own copy of "essay.txt" and can make changes to their own copy. they can view
                everyone elses, but they can only edit their own.</p>
            <h3 class="blog-heading">What is a remote?</h3>
            <p class="blog-body">A remote is a repo stored remotely. It is the specific URL that points to the repo in
                question. there can be multiple remotes for one project, usually in this case it is to give seperate
                read/write permissions to certain people. Its an added layer of security as it avoids people writing to
                the master by mistake.</p>

            <h3 class="blog-heading">How are remotes set up?</h3>
            <p class="blog-body">Remotes are set up via git. When you clone a repo to your local computer, the default
                remote is called "origin" and points to the repo address you origionally cloned. for instance, this repo
                is a forked repo, with the "origin" remote located at URL
                https://github.com/ben-sherwood/foundations.git. this points to a repo I own, which was initially forked
                from somewhere else. If i want to make sure I am tracking changes to the repo i forked from I need to
                set up a new remote that i can <git fetch> the changes from. it is simple to do this. the commands
                    are:<br>
                    1: git remote -v (This checks what remotes are currently set up.) <br>
                    2: git remote add (name-of-remote)
                    (desired-url)<br>
                    and there you go. as an example I will show what would be required to set up a remote that
                    can fetch changes from the repo i initially forked: <br>
                    git remote -v *(checking remotes)*<br>
                    git remote add eda-remote https://github.com/dev-academy-foundations/foundations *(name the
                    *remote and point it to the origional repo that I want to track)* <br>
                    git remote -v *(check that the new remote is set up)* <br>

                    to check for changes you can do the following:<br>
                    git fetch eda-remote<br>
                    git diff eda-remote/master origin/master (this will compare the differences between the
                    origin which points to our repo and the eda-remote master)<br>
                    if you are happy to merge the changes, you can use: <br>
                    git merge eda-remote.<br>

                    This is the safest way to do it, however using git pull eda-remote will both fetch and merge
                    in one step. this does not give you the change to check the changes before merging with your
                    current work.</p>

            <h3 class="blog-heading">How would you explain a remote to a non-technical person using an analogy?</h3>
            <p class="blog-body">The hint is in the title - its remote. Not on your machine. An analogy for a remote:
                When you log into gmail you can see all your emails, make changes to folders, create emails, delete
                emails, etc. If you go to the other side of the world, you can log into gmail and still find all the
                same files folders emails etc, despite being on a different computer. In terms of a repository, the
                remote is the *remote* storage of the repository. You can access this remote anywhere by copying or
                *cloning* the remote to your local computer - then one can make changes and send these changes back to
                the remote, so others can update their own copy - like if you create a new folder within your inbox from
                your phone, you will have to refresh the browser page to update and reflect the changes you made on your
                computer</p>

            <h3 class="blog-heading">How many times did you feel like "oh God I don't understand this"?</h3>
            <p class="blog-body">There were not too many times during this challenge, mainly because I had done a few of
                my own challenges previously. During THESE challenges however I did really struggle when I was trying to
                set up a new remote - you need to have the repo already created in github, and use the exact URL to
                point to it. I was using urls like https://github.com/ben-sherwood/test-repo which wasnt working because
                it needs to be https://github.com/ben-sherwood/test-repo.git and needs to exist on github before trying
                to set a new remote.</p>

            <h3 class="blog-heading">Create a Blog - Challenge. Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?
            </h3>
            <p class="date">11/03/2019</p>
            <p class="blog-body">My main frustrations came about from just not remembering all the things I learned at
                otago. I would have been able to pump out a pretty decently useable blog in 20 minutes, now I have
                completely forgotten lots of things - mainly good practice stuff like using divs and floating elements
                etc. This Will all come back in time but I was frustrated at the speed I was going.</p>
            <h3 class="blog-heading">If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made; was it what you
                pictured?</h3>
            <p class="blog-body">I have done quite a bit of web design before so I wasn't surprised. I built my first
                functioning html site 14 years ago (functioning is a generous term... it was solid blocks of color on a
                plain page!).</p>
            <h3 class="blog-heading">What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?</h3>
            <p class="blog-body">I really am enjoying defining clear goals for the day at the start of each day. It
                gives me something to work towards, and makes it much easier to be focused and efficent while working.
                If I know I have x number of tasks to do, it becomes easier to divide my time and give myself breaks:
                "When i have finished this task, I will have a cup of tea"</p>
            <h3 class="blog-heading">How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?</h3>
            <p class="blog-body">Today I am pretty happy with how I went and my understanding of the competencies.
                Sometimes it took some extra research to find the words I was looking for. I also think many of these
                skills like forking, cloning, fetching etc are skills that will very quickly become engrained.</p>
            <h3 class="blog-heading">Which parts of the work did you enjoy?</h3>
            <p class="blog-body">I am really enjoying the bit command line at the moment. Its fast and fun, and I am
                starting to appreciate how navigating file systems in command line is much easier and faster when you
                know the shortcuts.</p>
            <h3 class="blog-heading">Which parts of the work did you find tedious?</h3>
            <p class="blog-body">Sometimes I find the reflection questions tedious. The question "how would you describe
                remote to a non tech friend using an analogy?" I didnt like. I know that often if you can find an
                analogy it makes it far easier to an on looker (who knows about code) to see if the person has a real
                understanding of the concept. But for things like "remote" its very hard to find an analogy without
                using "remote" and remote and cloud are fairly similar, so i found myself using an email analogy.. which
                maybe isnt fully correct but seemed ok... perhaps this is just outlining that I have NO clue what im
                talking about! xD</p>

            <h3 class="blog-heading">A Story about HTML and CSS</h3>
            <p class="date">03/04/2019</p>
            <p class="blog-body">Once upon a time there lived a man named Hamish Tyson Martin-Luther – Quite the long
                name. He hated it. He lived a fairly normal life, a 9-5 construction job with good pay, working with
                many different people from all works of life with many different skill sets. He enjoyed what he did, but
                often felt that his job wasn’t that meaningful. All day he saw his constructions transformed by
                others into beautiful works of art for all to enjoy. One of his closest friends, Claire Shatner-Summers
                was an interior designer who he had worked with for years. She was incredible at taking a rather bland
                concrete wall and creating something beautiful. Hamish dreamed that maybe one day that would be him, and
                he would escape the grayscale of construction.<br><br>
                One evening after a long hard day, Hamish and Claire were having a drink, when Claire remarked “Hamish,
                you have seemed a bit down recently, is everything ok?” <br>

                “Well… now that you ask, I am feeling pretty low. I have spent my whole life following in my fathers’
                footsteps, creating office blocks and abodes, factories and farms, yet their beauty lies not in my
                handwork, but in the transformation they undergo when a designer works their magic. Why can’t I create
                art like that?” Hamish looked into the bottom of his pint trying desperately to avoid eye contact.
                Talking about his emotions was not something he was overly fond of doing.<br>
                “You know what Hamish? There is beauty in your work. There is beauty in the organisation of the chaos
                that is brick and mortar. When I come to design the interior of your buildings, I see geometry. I see
                nature in the shapes, and without that I cannot do what I do. The designs I make complement the
                buildings you build, and the buildings complement my design. They are one of the same. We create beauty,
                together".<br>
                Hamish smiled, he hadn’t thought about it like that.<br><br>
                As the sun lay down to rest, Hamish closed his
                eyes, ready for the day tomorrow and the beauty he would create from chaos.<br><br>
