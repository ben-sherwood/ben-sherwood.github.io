                    <h3> Growth Mindset and Neuroplasticity</h3>
                    <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
                    <p>
                        Historically people used to believe that our brains couldn’t develop past adolescence. Recent
                        advancements in our understanding of the brain have revealed that this is not the case. Our
                        brains change and adapt constantly, forming new neural pathways. The brains ability to change is
                        called neuroplasticity. Think of the brain like a big city. The routes we take all the time need
                        bigger roads as more traffic is travelling down these roads. These are our habits and our
                        default ways of thinking and feeling. If we change how we think, respond or act, we form new
                        roads. Consistently using these new ways of thinking and feeling encourage these paths to become
                        stronger, and in turn a habitual way of thinking.
                        This means that we all have the ability to change and develop, learning new skills, ways of
                        thinking, and ways of coping with emotional difficulties in new ways.
                        If we apply this to learning something like a coding language, when we learn something new, that
                        memory and skill has its own path in our brain, however its very new, and to maintain that
                        knowledge and make it easier to recall and use, we must put into practice this new bit of
                        information or skill. Understanding how this works allows us to put in place learning strategies
                        that encourage use of these new pathways.

                    </p>
                    <h4>Growth Mindset</h4>
                    <p>
                        Growth mindset is exactly that. It is an idea that we have the ability to grow and develop our
                        abilities and intellect by hard work and dedication. This looks like seeing a complicated
                        challenge you don’t know how to solve and rather than thinking “I cant do this” or “this is
                        beyond my ability” you might think something like “wow here is something I can learn” or “I’m
                        glad this is pushing me”. Carol Dweck’s ted talk on developing a growth mindset had a fantastic
                        example of what growth mindset is.
                        She said growth mindset in a school is rather than a student receiving a fail mark, they receive
                        the mark “not yet”. Not yet suggests that you haven’t failed or you are not able to do it, more
                        there are still gaps in your understanding, and there is space to learn and fill those gaps. For
                        me, I see growth mindset as an immensely personal way of thinking and learning. It doesn’t
                        matter who is around you and what their abilities are, growth mindset focuses on YOU and is only
                        limited by your desire and ambition.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Neuroplasticity and growth mindset go hand in hand. Understanding how we can develop and change
                        our brains give us the tools to maximize our skill and knowledge retention. Understanding that
                        we can change and develop is the core of growth mindset. “I don’t know how to do this YET
                        however I know I my brain can change, and I can create these new pathways”. That to me is the
                        core of neuroplasticity and growth mindset.

                    <h3>EQ vs IQ</h3>
                    <p>IQ is something pretty much everyone has heard about at some point. IQ or
                        intelligence quotient was initially used in the early 1900s to try and determin weather children
                        were intelectually disabled or disadvantaged, or simply just not applying
                        themselves at school. Several different areas tested including
                        logical reasoning, word patterns and naming objects. The creation of this test,
                        also known as the Simon-Binet IQ test, had very positive results both in europe
                        and America. High IQ is associated with the ability to learn and understand
                        new material, logical reasoning and abstract thinking. People with high IQs tend
                        to be good at analyzing information and find they will often succeed at challenging tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>EQ or Emotianal Quotient first appeared as early as 1964 however didn't gain
                        traction until the mid 1990s. EQ is the ability for people to recognize their own
                        emotions as well as those of others. More so, its being able to describe and understand
                        those emotions. Someone with high EQ will be able to use their understanding of their own
                        and others emotions to guide their decision making and react appropriately to challenging
                        situations. Someone with a high EQ may excell as a leader and do well in collaborative
                        environments.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately having a good balance between IQ and EQ is desireable. We can also strive
                        to better understand ourselves and how we respond to emotionally challenging situations.
                        Drawing from those experiences we can be more empathetic to others, as we have a better
                        understanding of how we respond to our own emotions.

                    <h3>Learning Plan</h3>
                    <h4>My Strengths:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Communication is something I would say I do very well. I have grown up in a very open and honest
                        family which has helped me be forthcoming with my problems. In the last 4 years I have been
                        medicated for MDD (Massive Depressive Disorder) and this has further helped my communication
                        skills. I am willing to ask for help when needed and admit when I am struggling. Working for
                        many years in hospitality has helped my communication by giving me experience working with
                        complete strangers and colleagues alike – very different to family and friends and has
                        encouraged my communication style to become adaptable.<br><br>

                        Honesty is another trait that I think is vital to good communication as communication isn’t
                        possible
                        if you are not completely open with your peers. I do my best to present all information to help
                        make
                        calculated decisions with others.<br><br>

                        Perfectionism could be both negative and positive, and I will come to the downsides in my
                        weaknesses. I try hard to do everything at 100%. I put a lot of pressure on myself to produce
                        the
                        best results I can.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Weaknesses:</h4>
                    <p>Oh boy there are many. Like I said above, far easier to criticise oneself than complement.
                        <br><br>
                        I am a very emotional person. I often let my emotions rule my decision making rather than having
                        a
                        balance of emotion and rationality guide me. I call this balance of rationality and emotions
                        wise
                        mind, and I try and balance myself when I am stressed and tired to prevent myself being
                        overwhelmed
                        by emotions which can be debilitating. <br><br>

                        Back to perfectionism. I often find that if I can’t do something exactly the way I want, I give
                        up.
                        I’d rather not do it than be disappointed with my result, and this has been a major player in
                        the
                        way I have lived my life. I am slowly getting better at dealing with this and hope it won’t be
                        too
                        much of a problem when it comes to this course.<br><br>

                        I also often withdraw into myself when things get tough. This is something I have been better at
                        recently, and rather than withdrawing I will communicate with people about why I feel like
                        running
                        away from what ever problem I have. Looking for support when I feel like this is essential to my
                        sticking power.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How I will manage myself:</h4>
                    <p>
                        With my main strengths and weaknesses outlined, lets have a look at how I can manage my time and
                        energy while completing this course.<br><br>

                        Firstly, while my communication is a strength, I often don’t really communicate with myself, and
                        this often leads to a snowball effect where I then get frustrated and withdraw into myself.
                        Something I have discovered even just since starting foundations is being organized cures this.
                        When
                        I say communicating with myself, I mean outlining and vocalising what it is I want, and how I
                        want
                        to achieve this. I started using sticky notes on windows to do this, by outlining weekly and
                        daily
                        things I want to achieve. I split larger tasks into smaller ones so I can continually feel a
                        sense
                        of accomplishment as I work. I think this has been incredibly helpful and I have since upgraded
                        from
                        sticky notes to an app called <a href="https://todoist.com/?lang=en">todoist</a>.<br><br> This
                        app
                        allows me
                        to have multiple projects each with
                        multiple tasks. I can set dates and times for each and drag and drop between different projects
                        and
                        deadlines. This makes managing my workload simple and also gives me the satisfaction of marking
                        things as complete. If I need to do something for someone, or get help from someone, I add these
                        in
                        as tasks. This again makes it easy for me to remain true to my commitments and keep up those
                        channels of communication.<br><br>

                        Seeking help isn’t something I should be afraid of, we learn by failing and reflecting, and
                        often
                        part of that reflection comes in the form of advice from others. My plan for seeking help is
                        this:<br><br>

                        Encounter problem – I look at the problem, try and break it down, and give myself a time limit
                        to
                        solve the problem on my own. If I still am struggling with a problem, I will seek help from my
                        peers
                        on slack. While waiting for a response I will keep on troubleshooting. Hopefully by this stage I
                        will have solved the issue on my own, if not the advice from others should be another tool to
                        solve
                        the issue. If all else fails after these steps my final place to turn is my facilitators. This
                        is a
                        last resort as I feel the best way to learn is to teach yourself, and asking others and helping
                        others is also a great way to help yourself, and them learn. I’m assuming my facilitators are
                        gods,
                        their time is better spent changing the world, not fixing my nav bar issues.<br><br>

                        What I do want to see from my gods is support. Encouragement, communication, advice and respect.

                    <h3>Values and Strenghts</h3>
                    <h4>My Values:</h4>
                    <p>So interestingly I have done a lot of work around beliefs and values as I was doing a type of
                        therapy called CBT. CBT is very value and goals focused. As part of this therapy I chose 6
                        values I feel are important to me. I got to 6 after going through a list of around 50. It
                        was quite a challenge to do this!</p>

                    <h4>Self-Knowledge</h4>
                    <p>Self-knowledge is very important to me. I was diagnosed with MDD (massive depressive disorder)
                        and the only way to have any chance of recovering is to have a strong sense of self and to
                        understand how I respond to the world around me. The more I learn about myself, the better I
                        can deal with any difficulty that arises.</p>
                    <a name="Contribution"></a>
                    <h4>Contribution</h4>
                    <p>Contribution is something I really hold as a core value. We can only progress as a community/
                        society/species if we make lasting and meaningful contributions to those communities. I want
                        my legacy to be something lasting I have done for my community. At the moment I am passionate
                        about making change in mental health awareness, I am just yet to decide how to do this.</p>
                    <a name="Growth"></a>
                    <h4>Growth</h4>
                    <p>Growth is similar to self knowledge. Growth is a biproduct of self knowledge as the more we
                        understand about ourselves, the more we grow as a person. Growth to me also means improving my
                        understandings of the world, my skills as an individual and my connection with my surroundings.

                    <h4>Generosity</h4>
                    <p>Generosity is exactly as it sounds. being generous with my time and my wealth. Offer it when and
                        where I can.</p>

                    <h4>Humilty</h4>
                    <p>Humilty is to conduct myself without ego, never assume anything about anyone, let my actions
                        reflect who I am. Be humble in my failures and in my successes.</p>
                    <a name="Family"></a>
                    <h4>Family</h4>
                    <p>Family is the cornerstone of my life. I stand upon the shoulders of my family, they are my
                        giants. I want to continue this value, and help build on this value to ensure those new members
                        can experience the love, kindness, and safety that my family has given me.</p>

                    <h4>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up
                        the
                        values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you
                        took.
                    </h4>
                    <p>I recently was walking home from the supermarket in Newtown. I witnessed two girls begin to
                        fight.
                        They were very aggressive towards each other, punching, kicking and hair-pulling. Many people
                        were
                        standing around some were avoiding the situation by crossing the street. <br><br>
                        I made a decision to stop the fight by putting myself between them, and quickly someone else
                        came to
                        help pull them apart. While I didn't have a huge amount of time to think about why I was doing
                        what
                        I was doing, I feel that I acted with humility - I didn't judge or assume, I just knew that if I
                        was
                        in that position, I would want someone to help deescalate the situation. It was also a situation
                        that allowed me to grow as a person. I am not a confident person, nor am I physcially imposing
                        but I
                        stood up for what I believe in and decided to stop two young people making a terrible mistake. I
                        made sure both girls were alright, so I guess you could say I was also generous? It wasn't a
                        nice
                        situation but I hate the idea of people standing around filming or laughing. Thats not the
                        person I
                        am.</p>
                    <h4>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h4>
                    <p>It's hard to say what my culture really is. I come from a family who encourage and respect
                        openness,
                        honesty, love, and diveristy. We thrive on our differences and celebrate thinking for ourselves
                        and
                        doing what we believe is right within our societies. I am lucky to be able to speak freely with
                        my
                        sisters and parents. This has given me an appreciation for listening to others and being open to
                        changes. I value family so highly as I am lucky to be from an incredibly caring network of
                        family
                        members. They encourage growth, and we always push eachother to discover new things about the
                        world,
                        our communities, and ourselves. This openness and caring environment breeds humility and I am so
                        greatful for that.</p>
                    <h4>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h4>
                    <p>Some of my strenghts are also weaknesses. For one, I am a perfectionist. I strive to be the best
                        I
                        can be when it comes to submitting work. Sometimes this prevents me from actually even starting
                        as I
                        am also so afraid of failure, or not being satisfied with the work I have done --- I think my
                        brain
                        also sees this as a failure. A big strenght of mine is being able to listen and understand
                        people. I
                        pride myself on my ability to interact with others and feel this will be a real asset when it
                        comes
                        to finding work, but also in learning as I can understand others well, which will help in
                        learning
                        from others as well as helping others when they may need it.</p>
                    <h4>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might
                        intersect with learning obstacles.</h4>
                    <p>I think my social skills will be vital on this learning journey as like I said above it means I
                        am
                        able to listen and understand other peoples ideas and perspectives, even if they are different
                        to my
                        own. When it comes to learning, experiencing problems from multiple angles can be incredibly
                        benefical as sometimes the best solution is one you wouldn't normally think of. Being surrounded
                        by
                        other people and being able to interact, listen, and understand is vital (in my opinion) to
                        learning. As far as obstacles go, being able to listen and communicate effecitvely can make mole
                        hills of mountains. It can turn a very complex and daunting challenge into something fun and
                        exciting, as you get to experience the issue from multiple different angles.</p>
                    <h4>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others,
                        but
                        there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective
                        they
                        were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h4>
                    <p>This might be a stretch, but its a recent example and one which I think outlines qualitites in
                        myself, and the other person involved. I was on the Spirit of New Zealand for a week with a
                        group of
                        26 other people all aged between 18 and 65(ish). The Spirit is a tall mast ship that has no
                        powered
                        form of winches to haul the sails up. Many aspects of the boat are very physical and require the
                        team to be cohesive. There was a situation where I was up one of the masts with a young girl, we
                        were preparing the sails to be hauled after riasing the anchor. Part of this process requires
                        you to
                        walk out along the yard (the wooden beams that run horizontal to the mast) and push a sheet off
                        the
                        yard. While out on the yards you are anywhere from 15m to 30m high, rolling from side to side
                        while
                        having to work with your hands. Its challenging. I loved being up in the rigging - its exciting,
                        physically challenging, and offers a breath-taking view of the sea and landscape around you.
                        Karleigha, the girl who was helping me did not share my enthusiasm for being up there, but
                        wanted to
                        experience life on the ship fully. She was out on the yard with me next to her, and was trying
                        to
                        push the sheet off the yard. She was having difficulty and wasn't enjoying being up that high.
                        She
                        asked if we could swap, however once out on the yard you cannot move past another person. I
                        offered
                        her encouragement and support and gave her some tips that I had found helpful while doing the
                        same
                        process on the upper square sails. Being positive and encouraging in the face of this challenge
                        I
                        think was essential to us managing to finish the work on the sails. Karleigha got the chance to
                        prove to herself that she could do it, and I think me helping not only gave her confidence but
                        also
                        gave myself confidence too. I had struggled and also found it challenging, so being able to
                        relate
                        while also offering things I had found helpful was a great way of removing the tensions we both
                        had,
                        and being positive and friendly also encouraged her to do the work - A fantastic experience in
                        learning and challenge for us both. In the future I think I would use the same positivity and
                        energy
                        that I used in that situation, however many of the challenges I will be facing I wont have
                        experienced before, so learning how to keep this positive energy while not knowing the solution
                        will
                        be vital. Its easy to lose hope when you dont know how to solve a problem. I think I like this
                        "positive/encouraging" approach is good because it encourages people to find solutions
                        themselves,
                        which is immensly rewarding. Karleigha was beaming after her achievement, and rightfully so. She
                        did
                        something she didn't think possible of herself, and I can't wait to have many of those moments
                        in my
                        learning journey with Dev Academy</p>
                    <h4>Post I shared to Slack</h4>
                    <p>Howdy friends - Time to share a bit about myself for sprint 1! My name is Ben Sherwood, and I am
                        based in Wellington. I grew up in Nelson, and spent some time studying down in Dunedin. I've
                        just
                        been doing some stuff around values and identity and wanted to share some things I have been
                        thinking about.
                        I have done quite a bit of CBT - Cultural behavioral Therapy, and this kind of therapy is
                        focused on
                        values and goal setting so I have quite a good idea about what my core values are. I am quite a
                        self
                        critical person, and what I found immensely valuable was hearing how my friends and whanau see
                        me,
                        and what they think my core values are. I think this is good at letting us now how we act, and
                        what
                        our actions say about our values. Some of the values I would say are important to me didn't come
                        up
                        at all when my friends and family talked to me about it, some did, and there were some new ones
                        too.
                        This highlights that perhaps there are some values that I need to focus on and make sure I am
                        living
                        to those values. Anyway sorry to ramble on about values!
                        One last thing .... Why am I doing Dev Academy? Easy. I'm doing it because I enjoy development,
                        I
                        like the creative yet technical challenges Web Development brings, and also I have some personal
                        projects that would benefit greatly from having experience in development!
                        Thanks a lot for tolerating this long post!</p>
